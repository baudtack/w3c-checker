* w3c-checker
  A simple perl script to pull down the source of a page and push it to the w3c validator for checking.

** Rational
   I've often had occasion where I'm running a local development server that 
   isn't web accessible (django for example). Combine this with the fact that
   many pages are rendered on the fly, as in the case where a template system
   is being used, and the validator becomes difficult to use. I have to either 
   make a publicly available development server,  which is more work, or copy 
   and paste the completed source by hand into the validator which is a pain. 
   So what I've done to avoid this problem is write a perl script that will 
   fetch the page and push it up to the validator.

** Use
   ./w3c-checker url
